// Today I started the Northcoders bootcamp. It was mainly going over git and github's basic functions,
// which I already have a pretty good grasp of because I've been using it to update this repo.

// We were given some tasks at the end of the day, which can be seen here: https://github.com/skypotatoes/word-play
// These were some exercises to get us used to the terminal command line, so it is good to have gained a bit more
// experience in how it works. The hardest bit was using grep to search for all words with 3 or more vowels in a
// list and then output those words to a file. For a while, I was trying a regex match which I was sure was correct
// but couldn't get it to work. In the end, it turned out I needed to use egrep rather than grep to get it to work
// with regex. Good to know.

// We were also sent these exercises to fork and clone: https://github.com/skypotatoes/remote-intro-week
// I don't think I was meant start them yet but once I got looking at them, I couldn't resist solving the array methods
// exercises. They are very simple tasks, especially compared to some of the kata I have been looking at over the last
// few weeks, however, by making them simple and requiring a solution using only array methods, it has helped me to learn
// the correct use of things like arr.filter() and arr.map(), which I have used before but was not as comfortable with as
// things like for loops. Had I not been restricted to using array methods, I think I would have probably tried to solve
// some of these with for loops. So after doing half a dozen or so of these, I feel I have a much better grasp of them.
// Anyway, I am going to refrain from jumping ahead and take a break from coding for the night. It's not even 7pm and I
// feel knackered. Not used to being up in the morning these days!
