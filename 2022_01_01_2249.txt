I've just realised the pages I upload here show up in alphanumeric order, 
rather than chronological order, therefore I will start putting the file 
names as YYYY_MM_DD_time rather than just a title.

For anyone interested (beyond me), the order the existing files were 
created was:

sumOfIntervals.js 
connect4.js 
get_digits_and_exp.js 
get_digits_and_exp_part2.js
